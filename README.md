# Commonsense Node.js Module

This project is the source for the (upcoming) npm commonsense package.

Currently under heavy development.

The API mainly follows the one from [Commonsense-javascript-lib](https://github.com/senseobservationsystems/commonsense-javascript-lib), although this is likely to change.
